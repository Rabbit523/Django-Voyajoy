                <p>
                    We love housing and hosting people. More than four years ago, we hosted thousands of guests from all
                    over the world in our homes in Los Angeles. We saw firsthand homesharing and sharing our spaces
                    fostered more empathy and more openmindedness in the guests that we hosted that we wanted to make
                    homesharing more pervasive. In order to do so and mitigate the barriers, we built smart automation
                    and marketing software to make the process easier for anyone. We believe in building great services
                    and beautifully- and intelligently- designed products that will touch millions of people experiences
                    throughout the world.
